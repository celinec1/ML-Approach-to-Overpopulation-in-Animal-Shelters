# ML-Approach-to-Overpopulation-in-Animal-Shelters

In this project, I aim to analyze the "Austin Animal Center Shelter Intakes and Outcomes" dataset to determine factors that contribute to the issue of poor outcomes for dogs. I focused on examining the relationship between age, breed, gender, and length of stay of dogs in the shelter, and their outcomes.

The goal is to provide insights into what factors contribute to certain outcomes for dogs and suggest improvements in breeding practices that could help reduce the number of dogs that tend to have poor outcomes. Furthermore, the findings can help shelter runners understand the tendencies and patterns of certain ages and genders of dogs, and use this information to improve their operations.


Methodology
I analyzed the "Austin Animal Center Shelter Intakes and Outcomes" dataset using data science techniques, including exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling. I used MATLAB programming language to visualize and analyze the data.
